//import UIKit

////loops
////for-in loops are blocks of code that run your code a specific amount of yourtimes
////can iterate over both arrays and dicitionaries
////helpful when wanting to repeat code
//
////iterating over an array
//var sponsors = ["adidas", "Etee Lauder", "carolina Herrera Good Girl", "Apple"]
//
//for sponsor in sponsors {
//    print("Shout out to \(sponsor) for helping make KWK happen!")
//    //sponsor WITHOUT an s is the variable representing each indiviual piece ofdata in the array
//}
////computer runs the same # of times as the # of elemeants in the array (in this case, it is 4 times)
//
////iterating over dicitonaries!
//var capitals = ["France" : "Paris", "Cuba" : "Havana", "Japan" : "Tokyo"]
//
//for pair in capitals {
//    print(pair.value)
//    print(pair.key)
//}
//
//for(countries, cities) in capitals
//
//print ("the spital of \(countries) is \(cities)")

////loops without collection
//
//for _ in 1...500{
//    print("hey i really want to annoy you!")


//1...4 represents the range of how many timwa the loop should run

var friends =  ["mya", "kaylin", "morgan", "sinead", "taryn"]
for eachFriend in friends{
print("hello \(eachFriend)")
}
